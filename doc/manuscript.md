# What is the best method to construct a representative spectrum from a cluster of ms2 spectra?

## Abstract

## Introduction

Clustering of ms2 spectra is a natural way to handle datasets where you for some reason expect many spectra to originate from the same analyte. By grouping together the spectra that appear similar one may have a better insights into which analyte that caused the spectra than when analyzing each individual spectrum by itself. However, for many application we would like to condense the information from the spectra in one cluster into a single representative spectrum. This is for instance useful in spectra library searching[], reannotation of spectrum repositories[], and label free quantification[].
